cube-ultracube=Ultracube-specific tips and tricks will appear in this section.
cube-vanilla=Vanilla tips and tricks will appear in this section.

cube-boiler=To get started in Ultracube you'll need to provide power for your factory using the [entity=cube-boiler], but it works a little differently from normal.\n\nIt's fuelled by the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube], and is capable of flash-boiling [fluid=water] to produce large amounts of [fluid=steam] very quickly.\n\nLike many machines in Ultracube, it's not necessary (or desirable) for the boiler to operate continuously. A single run of the boiler should produce enough stored [fluid=steam] to power your factory for some time. [entity=storage-tank] can be used to store [fluid=water] and [fluid=steam] and help ensure the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] gets used up promptly, rather than being left stuck inside half-way. However, be aware that excessive buffering can cause throughput issues of its own.\n\n[entity=pump] may be required for full capacity.\n\nIf the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] becomes stuck inside, you can pick up the [entity=cube-boiler] to receive [item=cube-dormant-utility-cube]. The same thing works for any similar machine or vehicle.
cube-logistics=[item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] must be delivered to various machines in order for your factory to operate.\n\nWhile the cube can be transported and inserted by hand, this won't be an effective long-term solution. There are many tools available that could help you to automate this work. For example:\n- [entity=filter-inserter]\n- [entity=fast-transport-belt]\n- [entity=decider-combinator]\n- [entity=cube-recovery-bay]\n\nIt might take a bit of getting used to, but don't be discouraged: there's nothing wrong with starting with something simple, or automated only partially, and gradually improving on your setup. More options will become available as you progress through the technology tree.\n\nSome tools have been provided to help you manage and monitor the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube]:\n- __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__Alerts__REMARK_COLOR_END__ will show the current location of the cube on the minimap. You can toggle these alerts on and off with __CONTROL__cube-toggle-alerts__, or in the mod settings.\n- The __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__cubecam__REMARK_COLOR_END__ lets you remotely view the cube. Open it with __CONTROL__cube-open-cubecam__ (or __CONTROL__cube-open-cubecam-fullscreen__ for fullscreen). The window size can be adjusted in the mod settings.\n\nThese keybindings can be changed in the settings.
cube-efficiency=Ultracube isn't designed to impose an excessive grind or require long stretches of idling. If you find yourself waiting around a lot for products to be completed, it's likely that there are design improvements that could be made to your factory.\n\nIn contrast to base Factorio, the total output of your factory will ultimately be limited not by machines or resources, but the effectiveness with which you employ the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube].\n\nIt can help to think in terms of "output per unit of cube-time".\n\nSome things you might want to consider include:\n- How to get the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] from place to place.\n- How to determine when a process can consume the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] without stalling, and automate delivery when it can.\n- Different ways to arrange machines and processes to reduce overheads, such as [item=fast-transport-belt] transit time.\n\nBuffering outputs can ease some issues, but keep in mind that excessive buffering can mask problems and make issues harder to diagnose when they do crop up.\n\nFinally, note that alternative processes and recipes you'll eventually discover are rarely a straight upgrade. Often, improvements in terms of cube-efficiency come at the cost of reduced resource-efficiency or increased complexity. You'll need to use your judgement to decide when (and to what extent) you switch over.
cube-ultralocomotion=[technology=cube-transitive-ultralocomotion] causes the vehicle acceleration and top speed bonuses of the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] to take effect even when placed in a train's [entity=cargo-wagon], not only when fuelling a [entity=locomotive].\n\nThis allows for effective automated high-speed transport of the cube over long distances, as the cube can be easily removed via [entity=fast-inserter] upon reaching its destination.\n\nEach [entity=locomotive] must still be supplied with a standard fuel source of its own, such as [item=cube-vehicle-fuel].
cube-deep-core-ore=[item=cube-deep-core-ore] can be found in [entity=cube-deep-core-vein] and extracted by the [entity=cube-deep-core-ultradrill], which must be powered by the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube].\n\n[entity=cube-deep-core-vein] deposits are rare and unlikely to be found close at hand. If necessary, a [entity=car] fuelled by the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube] could expedite your reconnaissance mission.
cube-loaders=[entity=aai-v2-loader] can directly insert or extract a full [entity=fast-transport-belt] filled with materials into or out of a container, machine or cargo wagon.\n\nHowever, [entity=bulk-inserter] is not completely obsolete: as well as being less flexible, loaders must still be powered, and consume a significant amount of electrical energy even when not in use. Use them wisely.\n\nUpgraded loaders such as [entity=aai-v3-loader] work similarly, with corresponding increases in power usage.
cube-nuclear-reactor=The [entity=cube-nuclear-reactor] in Ultracube must be kickstarted using the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube].\n\nConsuming a single cube as fuel will bring a reactor up to working temperature, at which point the reactor's heat connections will connect to allow heat to flow out, and [item=uranium-fuel-cell] may be inserted to continue normal operation.\n\nIf the reactor runs out of [item=uranium-fuel-cell] at any point, it will revert to its initial state, and must once again be kickstarted with the [item=cube-ultradense-utility-cube].
cube-mystery-furnace=When the [entity=cube-mystery-furnace] is fuelled by [item=cube-haunted-energy-cell], any item inserted can be sacrificed to the spirits for an item in return.\n\nThe spirits are fickle and hard to please, but those persistent enough might come away with something nice.\n\nAlternatively, use it to rid yourself of inconveniences.\n\nTake care, because the spirits will also happily accept[item=cube-haunted-energy-cell] itself, and always, remember to manage your [item=cube-residual-tendrils].
cube-quantum-decoder=The [entity=cube-quantum-decoder] works quite differently to most machines.\n\nIt can consume any of the following:\n- [item=cube-qubit-0]\n- [item=cube-qubit-1]\n- [item=cube-qubit-2]\n- [item=cube-qubit-3]\n- [item=cube-qubit-4]\n- [item=cube-qubit-5]\n\nThese items are consumed one at a time, but processed in pairs, with a result produced after every second input. The result produced depends on whether the pair of processed qubits was correct or not: [item=cube-qubit] for an incorrect pairing, or [item=cube-quantum-research-data] for a correct pairing.\n\nThe correct pairing of qubits is randomly determined for each [entity=cube-quantum-decoder] (individually), and changes randomly for a given decoder each time it successfully decodes.\n\nNote that:\n- Order does not matter: inserting [item=cube-qubit-0] followed by [item=cube-qubit-1] is the same as inserting [item=cube-qubit-1] followed by [item=cube-qubit-0].\n- Two copies of the same qubit is a valid pairing.\n\nThus, there are 21 possible pairings, and each is equally likely.
cube-helvetica-scenario=If you are determined, [recipe=cube-resonance-cascade] can be conducted in the [entity=cube-forbidden-ziggurat].\n\nPlease ensure you understand the risks: it would be wise to make the necessary arrangements beforehand.\n\nNote that [item=cube-productivity-module] will provide additional production of [item=cube-basic-antimatter-unit] only.
